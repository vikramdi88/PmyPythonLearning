Set - Data Type for Mutable, unordered collection of unique list 

e.g. You wan to find that which coinntry is using you website. 
You checked there are 700+ logings everyday from diff countries, but we know there is less than 700 countries in the world. 
Set can help to organize that data to find the countries 

Store the countries logged in a List 
Create a set from that List 

countries = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'C', 'B']
country_set = set(countries)
len(country_set) --> 3 

'in' and 'not in' menthods can be used 

Methods:
add() --> unlike append for list. The reason is that set is unordered so nothing can be added at last 
pop() --> random element is removed
union(), intersection() & other mathematical functions
